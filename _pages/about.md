I am an interdisciplinary researcher working at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Behavior Science, and AI/ML. I broadly explore problems related to better human data and feedback collection for AI, as well as personalizing user experiences at scale. My research has been applied across diverse fields, including recommendation systems, wearable health, crowdsourcing, and developer tools.


I work at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as their first Quantitative User Researcher, personalizing developer experiences in the age of AI. I was also a Research Scientist at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/), as a member of the Human-in-the-AI (HAI) Lab, and focused on human evaluation of recommender systems and modeling of users' streaming behaviors. 


I completed my PhD in Human-Computer Interaction from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, working with [Stephen Intille](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/intille/). I was fortunate to collaborate closely with [Seth Cooper](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/scooper/), [Genevieve Dunton](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/genevieve-dunton/), [Don Hedeker](https://stat.uchicago.edu/people/profile/donald-hedeker/), [Sam F Way](http://samfway.com/), [Jenn Thom](https://www.jennthom.com/), and Alice Wang. 

For my [dissertation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/AAI28962283), I introduced a novel experience sampling method using smartwatches to collect large-scale personalized self-report data in real-world settings. In addition, I built open-source tools for [multi-level modeling](https://reach-lab.github.io/MixWildGUI/) and [AI-assisted annotation](https://signaligner.org/) of longitudinal user behavior data to develop pattern recognition algorithms.


I regularly publish my work in peer-reviewed venues including PACM IMWUT (UbiComp), CSCW, IUI, WebSci, CHI PLAY, NeurIPS Workshops, Behavior Research Methods, Journal of Medical Internet Research, and Translational Behavior Medicine. **I am always excited about new product-oriented research or applied science opportunities.**
