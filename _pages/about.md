I am an interdisciplinary researcher who works at the intersection of HCI, behavior science, and AI/ML. I am interested in improving human data collection for AI development and personalizing user experiences at scale.


My research contributions have been applied across diverse fields, including behavior sciences, search and recommendation systems, wearable computing, crowdsourcing, and developer tools.



I work at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as their first Quantitative User Researcher, personalizing developer experiences for the Atlas platform. I was also a Research Scientist at [Spotify](https://research.atspotify.com/), where I was a member of the Human-in-the-AI (HAI) Lab, focused on human evaluation of interactive recommender systems and scalable content understanding methods for long-tail recommendations. 


I completed my PhD in Computer and Behavior Sciences from Northeastern University, Boston, MA working with [Prof. Stephen Intille](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/intille/). For my [dissertation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/AAI28962283), I introduced a novel experience sampling method using smartwatches to collect large-scale personalized self-report data in real-world settings. In addition, I built open-source tools to perform [multi-level modeling](https://reach-lab.github.io/MixWildGUI/) and [AI-assisted annotation](https://signaligner.org/) of longitudinal user behavior data for pattern recognition tasks.


I regularly publish my work in peer-reviewed venues including PACM IMWUT (UbiComp), CSCW, IUI, WebSci, CHI PLAY, NeurIPS Workshops, Behavior Research Methods, Journal of Medical Internet Research, and Translational Behavior Medicine. **I am always excited about new product-oriented research or applied science opportunities.**
